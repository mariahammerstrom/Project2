# Project2

In this project we compute the eigenvalues for the 3D harmonic oscillator with and without Coulomb interactions using a brute force Jacobi's method, as well as the numerical package Armadillo. Our results correspond with known analytical solutions.

This project consist of:

###Project2 (folder)
Contains the project code (C++) and selected results for runs of the code for the two different potentials.

###build-Project2-Desktop_Qt_5_5_0_clang_64bit-Debug (folder)
Contains the output files, plots and plotting code (Matlab).

###Report (folder)
Contains the report.
